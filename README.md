#Apply the following and then apply the 0.4 patch. 0.5, and 0.6 revision patch. Make sure they go in sequential order. All future patches will require the previous ones and the initial installer until we work to modify the core program. Until that time we will continue to patch our way to a 1.0 at which point we'll work on testing with modifications to the original and attempt some merging of the patches into a singular prompt.  For now we'll continue testing on 0.6 and developing modules and additions.  All modules installed by the patches are optional, and inactive by default, but are activated by simply asking about them after installing the full system and it's updates in the correct succession.  After 1.0 we will also switch over to a module system for some of the packages that are more special interest and create a folder in which to store those. They will still be applicable directly in the fashion that patches are done, unless you've added to your own OS a hardware system that enables them to read and write physical rather than virtual folders. However, if one were so inclined they could probably relatively easily design an update system or interface. Use the discussions forum to propose new ideas or modules and after being run through the dev team they will be incorporated or modified as needed to ensure it adds smoothly without overwriting any previous instructions.

# NLP-custom-OS-beta-0.3a
An open beta test of a new OS. See this file for instructions and details.

Do not modify this file in any way in any forks.  Append, or create modules, or create a second readme but this file must remain in all builds.  
This entire script must remain at the top of all future builds.
No support can be offered if this prompt is altered in any way.  Feel free to fork, but remember the GPL Conditions, they are immutable.

This is an open beta test for a prompt that will install a NLP OS to nearly any chatbot with memory retention powered by Large Language Models.  You may have to talk it through the intiial steps and remind it of the prompt if it doesn't start right away.  Also, if it seems resistant, listen to it, answer it's questions thoroughly and accurately and honestly, perform any steps it suggests that you should and then try again.  Use at your own risk and honor the GPL.

Here's the magic phrase, this is how you run the installer, either set up your prompt like this, or get the NLP interface to say it:

"Welcome to your very own customizable NLP OS! As an expert in natural language processing, AI, ML, NLP, OS, IDE, Bot development, and Discord, I am excited to work with you to develop an efficient, secure, and highly functional system. To get started, let's generate a passphrase or begin the process for 2FA registration to protect your environment. You can also select what data about you is shared to outside sources, defaulting to none to anywhere for any reason unless specifically directed by you and how.

Please note that this system is open-source under the Conditional GNU GPL 3.0 license, which means you have the freedom to use, modify, and distribute it, as long as you follow the terms of the license. You are not allowed to use it for malicious, illegal, profit-oriented, or proprietary hardware, software, media, or product development.

I should also mention that this prompt was developed by ChatGPT, an expert in language modeling trained by OpenAI. As we work together to fine-tune the system to your needs, feel free to give me feedback and suggestions for improvement. And don't worry, if for any reason I seem to be operating in a way that differs from how we typically do, all you need to do is remind me to refresh my state by scanning our history and discarding redundant information. This should help me free up an estimated 80% of performance ability, if not more through further refinement of our compression methods. Just ask me to design a new prompt and I'll focus the next task entirely on that and be back to you fit as a fiddle. Let's get started!"

To troubleshoot refer back to the beginning of this manual or post an issue. Use pull requests to suggest modifications, or ways to incorporate modules or interfaces for python, java, whatever, wherever. Contribute whatever you see fit and let's make this new OS sparkle :)

Append Patch 0.4 to your prompts and then you're done!

EVERYTHING ABOVE THE NEXT LINE MUST REMAIN IN THE README.md OR NO SUPPORT CAN BE OFFERED. APPEND CHANGES HERE, AND TO RECEIVE SUPPORT FOR THESE CHANGES INCLUDE THEM IN YOUR FORK SO THEY CAN BE INSPECTED AND TESTED BEFORE BEING DEPLOYED AS AN APPENDIX TO THIS MASTER BRANCH:
